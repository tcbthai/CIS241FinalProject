          <h4>Hello , my name is <span>Thai Tran</span></h4>
          <h2 class="mt-20 mb-20">I'm a Web Developer</h2>
          <p class="mt-20">
            I received my Bachelor of Information Technology from the Vietnam University of Sciences. I studied Computer
            Network and Telecommunication (manage a network, config routers, switches, setup and maintain a network...)
            in school. However, when I graduated from school and got a job related to my field of study, I decided to
            change
            my job from Network Administrator to Web Developer. It was hard for me but I think I made a good choice.
            Now, I am a Web Developer with 3 years of experience.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-20">It’s quite astonishing to notice that my presence in the United States has fondly been over
            4 years. Staying here, I couldn’t help myself to recognize who I am anymore. A cook, a karaoke singer, an
            individual who plays ball and listens to rap songs at the same time? Who were these kinds of people, and how
            long have they been living inside of me? However, what I did recognize is that I’m glad I am all of them.
            For they are the reason how I was able to meet, interact, and made friends and family with those around me.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-20">
            I love to play soccer in my free time. Soccer is the king of sports in my country. Yesterday, U22 Vietnam
            soccer team won a gold medal when they played against U22 Indonesia soccer team. Our country had been
            waiting for that medal for 60 years. A lot of people all around the country went out to celebrate this
            medal. I wish I could be there.
